    <p><b>Q. How about registration? What items need to be brought and what are the procedures?</b>
   <br> As far as registration is concerned, you need to bring whatever is specified in your offer letter. All
        those forms need to be filled up. Once you come here, there'll be a day of "Orientation" when
        you'll be introduced to the department. The next day, you'll have registration. This will involve
        opening an account at a bank, and your subject and hostel registration. Once this is done,
        you'll be issued an Identity card (keep it carefully, it is your identification on campus for at least
        4 years!) Congratulations! You're now a student at IIT-R!.</p>

        <p><b>Q. Wait a minute! What about the banks? Give me some details!</b><br>
            Okay, there are 2 major banks on campus: Punjab National Bank and State Bank of India. You
have to open an account with one or the other. They both have A.T.M.s on campus. To see
the locations of the A.T.M.s you should check out the institute maps and also the details of the
facilities here. With your account you'll also get online banking and A.T.M. cards.
        </p>

        <p><b>Q. Will there be any other formalities afterwards for registration?</b><br>
            There will be, a little later, an online registration for which a notice will be put up. That's a simple
process which you'll be guided through...
        </p>
        <p><b>Q. What's the climate like?</b><br>
            You'll see a continental, read extreme, climate. This means that it starts getting cold in
about November.
        </p>
        <p><b>Q. What are the requirements for online classes?</b><br>
        All u need is a good net connectivity and a device(with webcam) that can run the necessary programs- MS Teams, Cisco Webex, Google Meet etc. We also recommend a pair of headphones/earphones that come with microphones. Be prepared for 8 hour sessions, and a exhaustion that follows.
    </p>

    <p><b>Q. How will I communicate with the Proffessors?</b><br>
    On registeration, each student recieves an institute e-mail id which serves as the primary mode of communication between the students and the institute. Many important notices are floated here, including but not limited to information regarding courses and classes. Aside from mail, students tend to make branch-wise whatsapp groups, where representatives are chosen, who maintain contact with proffesors on class-wise or batch-wise levels and relay the information to students.</p>

    <p><b>Q. What about the tutorials?</b><br>
    While practicals fo most courses have been postponed to the (hopefully) upcoming offline semester, tutorials still continue to haunt the junta. Tutorials are also conducted via Teams which has an integrated assignment feature for each course. Proffesors or TAs give assignments with aset deadline. One must solve the assignment within that deadline. Submissions are made usually by scanned PDFs of written solns. Do not, at any costs, forget to hand in your assignment once your submission is uploaded. </p>

    <p><b>Q. How can I study outside of lectures?</b><br>
    Feeling brave, are we? Proffesors usually provide study material to the students via mail or via class representtive. U will also be given electronic access to the library for other references. Some lectures can also be accessed via NPTEL, our digital platform where courses from various IITs are available. </p>
