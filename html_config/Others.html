                <h1>E-cell</h1>
                <p>
                    Entrepreneurship Development Cell, IIT Roorkee is
                    a student group which aims to promote
                    entrepreneurship in campus. IIT-R, being a placement
                    centric institute (by that we mean people killing for
                    jobs), has witnessed a very slow increase in the
                    enthusiasm of students towards entrepreneurship.
                    The members of this group, when not busy with
                    their own startups and garnering crores of turnover
                    for their companies, help in organizing talks,
                    meet-ups and other events that aim to support other
                    entrepreneurs of the campus.
                </p>
                <h1>Watch-Out</h1>
                <p>
                    Watch Out! is the offcial news and media body of
                    IIT Roorkee, the group responsible for the creation
                    of this Freshman Guide. We cover the happenings
                    and ongoings of life at IIT Roorkee along with the
                    issues that surround the administration,
                    placements, academics, cultural council and
                    bhawans. Some editorials and notorious fake
                    news pieces also make way on our website and
                    Facebook page. In conjunction to the web
                    presence, a print magazine is distributed every
                    semester. 
                </p>
                <h1>Geek Gazette</h1>
                <p>
                    Started 6 years ago as a technology oriented
                    magazine, Geek Gazette functions under
                    the aegis of the ACM IIT Roorkee Chapter.
                    Growing out of their original aim, GG has
                    expanded to include topics even obliquely
                    related with technology. The functioning is
                    similar to other magazines in the campus,
                    with the magazine being divided into four
                    verticals: Editorial, Finance, Design and
                    Web Development. They come out with a
                    self-nanced semesterly issue which
                    opines about topics that are covered in
                    extensive detail in the boundless abyss
                    famous around the world as the internet.

                <h1>Design Studio</h1> 
                <p>
                    Design Studio is the official design group of IITR. And no,
                    they’re not partners-in-crime with the fine arts section.
                    ‘Design is the art of problem-solving’ is a common phrase
                    you’ll probably hear them saying every time they try
                    explaining to you the difference. DS handles design
                    projects of various kinds, both on and off campus. Their
                    on campus contributions include becoming the Design
                    partners for various events and exhibitions of IITR and
                    o campus involves designing websites, apps, logos etc
                    for nice companies.

                    IITR campus. Finance Club not only leads one onto a path
                    of career development in finance but it also promotes self
                    development of its members. The club members get it all,
                    ranging from hard work to partying even harder.

                    newcomers are prepared for. Be it NISM certications or
