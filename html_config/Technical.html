                <h1>SDSlabs</h1>
                <p>
                    SDSLabs is one of the most iconic groups
                    of IITR. It’s initiation in 2010 acted as a
                    symbol of hope for the geek community
                    who were tired of being branded as uncool
                    nerds and banished from the happening
                    places on the campus.. SDS also includes
                    various other subsections like Programming and Algorithms Group (PAG), Data
                    Science Group (DSG) and InfoSecIITR.Attend their lectures and workshops, and
                    keep an eye out for the competitions they
                    regularly hold, as winners may get to skip
                    the boring tests and buzz straight to the
                    interviews 
                </p>
                <h1>IMG</h1>
                <p>
                    Formed as IITR’s website management group
                     in 2000-01, IMG was formally established in
                    the spring of 2001 -02. It was set up as the
                    first ever student organization to provide free
                    and friendly online resources to the IITR junta.
                    Acting as a gathering point for aspiring
                    web-developers, IMG quickly began to take
                    responsibilities of Institute level projects such
                    as managing the offcial website of the institute,
                    registration online,and other ancient entities
                    which if we mention, will only embarrass them.
                    13 years down the line, members of IMG
                    have alienated themselves from the clutches
                    of the administration and function as an
                    independent student body (maintaining some
                    vital apps of Placement Online and
                    Academics).
                </p>
                <h1>MDG</h1>
                <p>
                    Once a part of SDS, MDG is now an
                    independent student group of developers
                    and designers focused on creating useful
                    mobile applications for the IITR junta and beyond.
                    Despite the name and initial motivation
                    behind the group, MDG now explores
                    a lot of dierent Computer Science domains
                    and is a major contributor to
                    the lovely development culture of IITR.
                    Join them in
                    their interactive workshops, learn about the
                    latest in the Tech-world
                    and watch out for their latest podcast called MDG Talks.
                </p>
                <h1>PAG</h1>
                <p>
                    The programming and algorithms group spearheads the
                    competitive programming movement in the campus.
                    Like SDS and IMG, this group is held in high regard for
                    converting novice programmers into lucrative
                    and sought after coding machines for companies
                    and varsities alike. Organizing intra campus coding
                    competitions and sending contingents to national
                    and international competitions are some of
                     the activities this group undertakes. Overhearing someone
                    sleep talk about syntaxes and maths jargon
                    is a scientically proven way to identify a member.

                </p>
                <h1>INFOsec</h1>
                <p>
                    Founded in 2016, InfoSecIITR is a group of information
                    security enthusiasts. They regularly participate in
                    competitive hacking competitions and have been
                    consistently ranked among the top 3 CTF teams in India. Like
                    their sister groups, they also conduct a number of
                    competitions and workshops to raise awareness about the surprisingly niche eld of cybersecurity.
                    Recruitment cracker: None. InfoSecIITR is an open group and
                    everyone is invited to attend their meetings, with
                    regular participation being the only entryway into the core
                    team.
                </p>
                <h1>IITR Motorsports</h1>
                <p>
                    Humans (read aliens) with brains where neuron-transmitted
                    electrochemical signals are so mechanical that they
                    manage to fabricate a Formula Style Race car in a span
                    of 365 days (which may appear the same they made last
                    year but still different somehow), grace this group.
                    The Formula Style Race car is engineered for an
                    international collegiate Design competition called
                    Formulae Student, organised by IMechE (Institution of
                    Mechanical Engineers). The Race cars have already
                    own worldwide, from Australia in 2011 to UK in 2013,
                    and have managed to secure positions as high as 2
                    out of 149.
                    Some knowledge of car parts
                    and interests in cars will do the trick. If you are in
                    Mech. Engg., then surely this group will be your
                    extended family.
