            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <p1><font size="5">Physical recreation through games and sports has been an important part of the Institute since its inception. Games like football, cricket and hockey were introduced around 1870 followed closely by squash and boating. The practice of holding an Annual Athletic Meet was started in 1873. Rowing in the Ganga Canal has remained one of the most popular sports since 1901, and the Annual Boat Regatta is a popular and keenly awaited event every year. The Lion Trophy, the most prestigious and coveted prize in sports was instituted in 1912. Today, the Institute has some of the best facilities in a number of games and sports and awards proficiencies in 14 games. The tradition continues, as students of the institute keep making use of the marvellous sports facilities to excel in sports and games. In order to motivate the students and to get them interested in sports, a special scheme of NSO (National Sports Organisation) has been started from the session 2007-08.
