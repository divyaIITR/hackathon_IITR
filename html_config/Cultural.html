                    <h1>Dramatics Section</h1>
                    <p>
                        The broadway of IITR you can easily identify the members of the dramatic section by their insanely loud voices
                        and a deep,almost incomprehensible devotion to their scripts.Known for their religious practice routine and a 
                        fierce perfection in plays that make people laugh, cry, angry,and in a few cases, scared, the dramatics section 
                        performs 3 stage plays and one street play every academic year.For recruitment one must have a boomimg voice and
                        a repertoire of cheesy bollywood monolouges.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Choreography and Dance Section </h1>
                    <p>
                        If you are a typical Indian dancer who reluctantly dances
                        in baraats, this section is not for you. Although, saying
                         that it requires prodigious dancing skills (that make
                         Mithun Da go Kya baat, 3 times) isn’t completely
                         accurate either. Choreo (in IITR lingo) trains parttime
                         dancer IITians into complete performers. Their shows
                         are generally filled with power-packed performances,
                         with the dance-forms ranging from Jazz, Western and
                         Contemporary to typical Bollywood, Punjabi and South
                         Indian. You get to glimpse their year-long hardwork in
                         the cultural week, their performances in Footloose
                         (Thomso event) and flash mob(s) they organize in
                         Thomso and Cogni. If you are really lucky, you get to star
                         in your very own YouTube music video (read: Shape of You)
                         and face an onslaught of selfie requests from the insane
                         fandom.

                    <h1>Music Section</h1>
                    <p>
                        Music is a way of life at IITR. After being classified on the basis of
                        gender, year, branch,group, societies and number of Bun Samosas
                         you can eat in a day, you can, and will be, classified on the basis
                        of the kind of music you listen to. The Music Section of IITR consists
                         of some very remarkable artists who showcase their talents and
                        semester-long hard work at shows like Prelude, Dhun and
                        Swaranjali. The diversity of artists in this section is quite unique.
                         From Indian classical to western hard rock, this group has all
                        kinds of musicians, each with a distinct taste in Music. Selection
                         in this group is based purely on skill.

                    <h1>Cinematics Section</h1>
                    <p>
                        CineSec (in IITR lingo) is dedicated to film and videomaking on campus. Equipped with professional
                        cameras and instruments, CineSec is responsible for
                        creating short movies, campus news and trends,
                        interviews, animations,info-videos, event coverages
                        and feedbacks on events in IITR campus. This
                        section deals in various aspects of movie making
                        such as scripting, editing, direction and production.
                        Their works can be found on their official Youtube
                        channel. Though it’s not always true, their work can
                        be a little too abstract at times.
                         A knowledge of filmmaking is
                        not necessary. You just need to be a film-enthusiast
                        and show an understanding of what elements are
                        required. Warning: making a film/video is a very 
                    </p>
                    <h1>Kshitiz</h1>
                    <p>
                        Kshitij is the official literary magazine of IIT Roorkee.
                        They publish stories and poems written by the students
                        who are part of it and also host open editorials (in both
                        Hindi and English). The frequency of publishing varies
                        from 3-4 magazines per year. Like their fellow campus
                        magazine Geek Gazette, their team has four verticals:
                        Editorial (Hindi & English), Finance, Web-Design and Design.

                    <h1>The Debating Society</h1>
                    <p>
                        Fondly known as the DebSoc, the section is filled
                        with people who pride themselves over formulating
                        arguments over things they might or might not
                        have a pinheads’ worth of knowledge about. Their
                        facebook pictures inevitably feature a podium, a
                        raised hand and Debsoc members themselves;
                        however, these pictures should not be
                        misinterpreted as Nazi propaganda. The society
                        also conducts knowledge sessions and open
                        debates for the betterment of the IITR junta,
                        featuring topics such as economics, geopolitics
                        and history.
                        No previous debating/public
                        speaking experience is required. Only a knack for
                        logically and rationally thinking out things will be
                        enough for you to become a part of the society
